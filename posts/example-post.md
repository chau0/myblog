# Welcome to My Dev Blog

This is my first post on this minimalist development blog. I built this platform to share thoughts on programming, self-hosting, and building clean, effective solutions.

## What You'll Find Here

I plan to write about:

- **Clean Code**: Best practices for writing maintainable software
- **Self-Hosting**: Running your own services and infrastructure
- **Development Tools**: Tools and workflows that improve productivity
- **Performance**: Optimizing applications and systems

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

```typescript
// Simple, fast, and maintainable
const techStack = {
  framework: 'Next.js',
  language: 'TypeScript',
  styling: 'Tailwind CSS',
  deployment: 'Vercel'
};
```

## Philosophy

I believe in:

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

This blog reflects that philosophy - no unnecessary features, no tracking, just content that matters.

## What's Next

Stay tuned for posts about development best practices, self-hosting adventures, and the tools that make our work better.

Thanks for reading!
